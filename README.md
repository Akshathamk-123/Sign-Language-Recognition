# Sign-Language-Recognition


This is a part of a Huge project that I had taken up

This project envisions to help the differently abled students by recognizing the sign language

I have used Computer Vision OpenCV and media pipe to go about this task 

It is successfullly able to recognise the alphabets that is shown 

This was done on a Hackathon called Kodikon organised by Embrione club of PES University, 10th and 11th of September,2022
